\chapter{Government Policy and Externalities}
We have primarily examined what might what be called ``free market economies,'' where agents act without any government policy. In particular, we have acted under the assumption that one agent's consumption and behavior cannot affect another agent's behavior except through the market mechanisms. However, in the real world, certain behaviors impose externalities upon other agents. In order to examine the policy responses to these externalities, we need to understand how to model government policymaking, taking into account how agents will respond to the policy, and what types of objectives governments might have.

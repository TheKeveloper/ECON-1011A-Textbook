\chapter{Market Power}
So far, we have focused on markets with \emph{perfect competition}. Recall that in section \ref{sec:single_firm_setup}, we defined markets as being perfectly competitive if no every agent is a \vocab{price-taker}. That is, every firm assumes that the price is fixed and that their choices do not affect the market price. This is typically the case where there are many buyers and sellers, so each agent's choices have negligible effect on the market price. 

Note however, that being in perfect competition does \emph{not} mean that the agents decisions do not have some effect on the market price, as in the case of general equilibrium analysis from \ref{ch:general_equilibrium}. In general equilibrium with a finite number of agents, every agent's choices have an effect on the market price. However, the key is that each agent \emph{behaves} as if the market price is fixed. That is, they do not take into the account the fact that their choices can change the price. This precludes, for example, producing less to restrict demand in order to raise the price per unit of a good sold. 

In this chapter, we drop the assumption that all agents are price takers, and instead analyze the case where firms can affect and, importantly, \emph{behave} as if they can affect the market price based on their production decisions. 

\begin{definition*}[Market Power]
    We say an agent has \vocab{market power} if the agent makes decisions taking into account the fact that their choices will affect the market price. 
\end{definition*}

\section{Monopoly}
In the simplest case of market power, there is a single agent on one side of the market. When there is only a single firm that produces goods, we say that firm is a \vocab{monopoly}. 

Since there is only a single firm, the quantity of the good supplied in the market, $q$, is entirely determined by that single firm. Since the market price is determined by the total supply and demand of a good, then this implies that the market price is a function of the the monopolist's quantity produced: $p = p(q)$. 

The price function, $p(q)$, is known as the \vocab{inverse demand function}, because instead of telling us how many goods are consumed for a given price, it tells us the price for a given number of goods consumed. The more supply there is, the lower a price the monopolist can charge and still sell all of the produced goods, so we assume 
\begin{align*}
    p'(q) < 0
\end{align*} 
That is, the greater the quantity produced, the lower the price faced by the monopolist

The monopolist's goal is still to maximize profit. Given a cost function $C(q)$, the monopolist's problem is
\begin{equation*}
    \max_{q \geq 0} p(q) q - C(q)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Solving the monopolist's problem}
As with the case of perfect competition, we solve the monopolist's problem by solving for the first order condition. We simply differentiate with respect to $q$ to obtain,
\begin{align*}
    p(q) + p'(q) q = C'(q)
\end{align*}

\begin{definition*} [Marginal Revenue]
    The left hand side of the equation, $p(q) + p'(q) q$, is known as the \vocab{marginal revenue} of the firm. Notice that in the perfectly competitive case, $p'(q) = 0$, so the marginal revenue is a constant equal to the market price. However, in the monopolist's case, where $p'(q) < 0$, marginal revenue is a decreasing function of quantity. 
\end{definition*}

Assuming that there are increasing marginal costs, $C'(q) > 0$, then it is clear that the monopolist will produce less than the perfectly competitive firm. For any given $q$, $p(q) + p'(q) q < p(q)$. This implies that when the firm is optimizing, the value of $C'(q)^*$ must be lower in the monopolist case, and hence a lower value for $q^*$. This accords with our intuition that monopolies will restrict demand in order to charge a higher price. 

We can gain an additional piece of insight by rearranging the left hand side of the FOC.

\begin{align*}
    p + \partials{p}{q} q &= p \left(1 + \partials{p}{q} \frac{p}{q}\right) \\ 
    &= p \left(1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_D}\right) \\
    &= p \left(1 - \frac{1}{|\varepsilon_D|}\right)
\end{align*}
Where $\varepsilon_D = \partials{q}{p}\frac{p}{q}$ is the elasticity of demand with respect to price. 

Recall that we can think of the elasticity of demand as (roughly), for a 1\% increase in price, by how many percentage points does quantity decrease? The inverse elasticity of demand, $1/|\varepsilon_D|$, therefore tells us how many percentage points the market price will decrease if the monopolist increases the quantity produced by 1\%. 

It is clear then that the monopolist will never produce at quantities where the demand function is \emph{inelastic} ($|\varepsilon_D| < 1$), as this would result in negative marginal revenue. Intuitively, if consumers are inelastic, a small decrease in the quantity produced results in a large increase in the market price, which means that the monopolist could increase revenue by reducing the quantity produced. Thus the monopolist would continue reducing their quantity produced until the it reached the elastic portion of the demand curve.

This also tells us that all else equal, \emph{monopolists produce less in cases where consumers are more inelastic}. 

\subsection*{Choosing quantity or price}
In the above model, we considered monopolists as choosing the quantity produced and the market price as a function of the quantity produced. However, we could also think of the monopolist as setting a price $p$, and then producing a quantity $q(p)$ in order to satisfy the demand for the good at price $p$.
\begin{align*}
    \max_{p \geq 0} p q(p) - C(q(p)) \equiv \max_{q \geq 0} p(q) q - C(q)
\end{align*}

While a it is equivalent for a monopoly to choose either quantity or price, this is \emph{not the case with more than one firm}, as we will see in the next section. 

If we think of monopolies as choosing price, the intuition about consumer elasticity becomes more clear. If consumers are price inelastic, the monopolist can raise prices by a lot while only reducing consumer demand by a small amount, so the profit maximizing monopolist will raise prices (equivalent to reducing production). Conversely, if consumers are price elastic, a small change increase in the price results in a large decrease in quantity demanded, which means that the monopoly is less able to raise prices without reducing their total revenue.
